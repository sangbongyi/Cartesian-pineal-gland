# Cartesian pineal gland
**_Stepper motor controller that rotates an aluminum tube to fold/unfold the membrane antenna of the device. This code allows the Arduino-every board to operate a stepper motor to change the shape of the folding membrane of the antenna. While it folds, it changes the receiving radio frequency by changing the exposed surface of copper trace on the membrane. It also activates the TDA5767 radio module that receives an FM signal from the antenna._**

## Introduction

The name “Cartesian pineal gland” means Rene Descartes’s pineal gland. The pineal gland is a small organ inside of the brain and it produces melatonin which regulates sleep patterns. However, in the 17th century when renowned philosopher Rene Descartes lived, nobody knew what this organ was.

This apparatus uses Rene Descartes’s hypothesis about the pineal gland as text data and magnetic memory core as a storage device. It magnifies the physicality of data and information by showing intermingled points between intangible data and physical material.

## Interaction diagram
It transmits a character by a character from texts written by Descartes as an input into the device. The control module converts them to ASCII binary code and sends one bit of data to each memory core. Then generated signals flip the magnetic polarity of memory cores and induce voltage from it. These voltage spikes from the memory core turn on the electronic magnet and magnetic flux around the electromagnet distort laser reflection on the surface.
