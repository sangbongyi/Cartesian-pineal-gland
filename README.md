# Cartesian pineal gland
**_This installation has two different devices. the first is an LCD module, and the second is a magnetic memory module.
First, the LCD / ASCII data controller converts a character into an 8-bit binary and transmits it to the memory core module. The code for the display module allows the Arduino to display text on the screen and it converts each character into ASCII one by one and sends it to the memory module. 
Second, the magnetic memory module operates L293 to apply current to the wire passing through the ferrite core to store the binary data from the controller. Also, when the data is stored in the core, the induced voltage spike triggers an electromagnet and makes its magnetism generate laser diffraction._**

## Introduction

The name “Cartesian pineal gland” means Rene Descartes’s pineal gland. The pineal gland is a small organ inside of the brain and it produces melatonin which regulates sleep patterns. However, in the 17th century when renowned philosopher Rene Descartes lived, nobody knew what this organ was.

This apparatus uses Rene Descartes’s hypothesis about the pineal gland as text data and magnetic memory core as a storage device. It magnifies the physicality of data and information by showing intermingled points between intangible data and physical material.

## Interaction diagram
It transmits a character by a character from texts written by Descartes as an input into the device. The control module converts them to ASCII binary code and sends one bit of data to each memory core. Then generated signals flip the magnetic polarity of memory cores and induce voltage from it. These voltage spikes from the memory core turn on the electronic magnet and magnetic flux around the electromagnet distort laser reflection on the surface.
